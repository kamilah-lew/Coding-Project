In Assignment 1 for my Money and Banking Class I used MATLAB to look at the trend of GDP, household final consumption, total business investment over the years. 
 And looked at the correlation between the level of the overnight money market financing and the growth rate of GDP and overnight money market financing and CPI.

 In my assignment for my econometrics class Using 2011 Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) to look at the relationship between Wage, age, years of schooling and the province they are located in.

 Outside of class, I did some fun coding projects in Python as well. One is coding and decoding letters. Another one was building a frequency table to add availability for gamers to send emails based on their availability.
